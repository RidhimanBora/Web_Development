        <em>This text is emphasized.</em>
        <!-- *Note: Semantic tags like <em> and <strong> not only change the style of the text; they define the purpose of the element. 
        In fact, most screen readers recognize semantic tags and pronounce their content in a different tone! -->
        
        <br>
        
        <i>This text is in italics</i>
        <!-- However, unlike <em>, <i> is used to mark content that falls out of the context of the sentence,
        e.g. a foreign word or the name of an object. Here we stylized the word "few", 
         as otherwise the sentence would simply not make sense: -->
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The pronoun <i>few</i> is used for countable objects.</p>

        <p>Normal text vs <b>Text in bold</b></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This is <strong>important</strong> text.</p>
        <!-- The <strong> tag defines important text. Browsers display it as bold text, but it also carries a semantic meaning: -->
    
        Here is some <u>underlined</u> text.
        <!-- Using <u> tag, you can underline text in HTML -->

            <p>The mark tag is <mark>useful</mark> when you need to highlight important information.</p>
            <!-- The <mark> tag highlights HTML text in bright yellow color to resemble using a highlighter pen. 
            It’s used to denote content that’s more relevant to the user than the rest of the text: -->
        </div>
        <div>
            <ins>This text is inserted</ins>
            <!-- The <ins> tag marks inserted HTML text and underlines it -->

            <p>I am not deleted text, but <del>I am.</del></p>
            <!-- If you want a strike-through effect, use the <del> tag to cross out your HTML text. It will mark it as deleted: -->
       
                <p><s>This text is not relevant.</s></p>
                <p>This is the new accurate text.</p>
                <!-- he <s> tag creates a similar visual effect as <del> but has a different semantic meaning.
                 It defines a text that is no longer relevant: -->
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Paragraph with <small>smaller text</small> in it.</p>
                <!-- The <small> tags can be used to make the text smaller without changing the height of the line. 
                It's handy for adding notes or inserting something not as essential as the main information: -->


                <p> Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub><sup>12−</sup></p> 
                <!-- The <sub> tag creates subscript text which is half the size of the usual text and also has a lower line. 
                On the other hand, the <sup> tag makes the text smaller while raising the text line. 
                It’s great for mathematical and chemical formulas, like this one: -->
